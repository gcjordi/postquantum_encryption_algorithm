# NTRU_cryptography
A Post-Quantum Encryption Algorithm

NTRU is an open-source public key cryptosystem that uses
lattice-based cryptography to encrypt and decrypt data. Unlike
other popular public-key cryptosystems, it is resistant to
attacks using Shor's Algorithm and its performance has been
shown to be significantly greater. 

A form
of data compression has also been implemented and it has
been tested whether data compression and expansion during
the encryption-decryption process results in original data with
no or minimal loss.

## Cloning
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gcjordi/resistant_postquantum_encryption_algorithm.git
```

## Dependencies
